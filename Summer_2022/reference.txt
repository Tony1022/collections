0. download the driver from:
ftp://download.newport.com/MotionControl/Current/MotionControllers/SMC100/Software/
(ftp type: copy the link to your FILE EXPLORER in your laptop/computer, NOT the browser)

1. Connect the device (RS232 out, USB to laptop/computer)
2. Open NI-MAX, set Baud rate=57600, set Flow control=XON/XOFF, then save.
3. Put the driver (SMC100) to LabVIEW XXXX/user.lib
4. Open 'SMC100_Communication.llb'
5. 9 test on port_init.vi and read_write.vi
	- port_init.vi: Use different 'SerialPort' number to run the program until no error given out, 
it will give you the connection name (VISA Handle out), use this name for other vi's 'VISA Handle in'
	- read_write.vi: Use 'VISA Handle out' from port_init.vi to run the program. If no error, then the driver works.
